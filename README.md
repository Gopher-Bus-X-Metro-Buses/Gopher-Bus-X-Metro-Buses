# Gopher Buses X Metro Buses
##### *By: Adam, Ken, Riley, Will*
Our website includes maps of live-location **Gopher Buses along with Metro Buses and Lightrails** in the area surrounding campus. 
Our motivation is to **increase accessibility** of campus transportation for students. The primary goal is to include Metro buses and lightrails
in a format visually similar to the [Gopher Trip Website](https://umn.rider.peaktransit.com/).

Our website allows for concurrent, live updating view of both Metro Transit and University of Minnesota transportation options.

The University of Minnesota has included the [Transit Pass](https://pts.umn.edu/Transit/Transit-Passes/Universal-Transit-Pass "UMN Transit Pass") for students who pay the Transportation and Safety Fee (most students). 
The Transit Pass allows students to have access to the Metro Transit buses and the Green and Blue lines.
